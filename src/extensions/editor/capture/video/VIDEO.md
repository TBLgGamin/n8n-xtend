# Workflow Capture — Demo Video

**Filename:** `capture.mp4`

## What to record

Screen-record a short walkthrough (30–60s) showing:

1. A workflow open in the n8n editor with multiple nodes visible
2. Clicking the camera icon in the top toolbar
3. The export menu appearing with PNG and SVG options
4. Selecting PNG — the file download beginning
5. Opening the downloaded image to show it captured the full canvas

## Tips

- Use a workflow with 6–8 nodes spread across the canvas so the capture value is obvious
- Record at 1280×800 or higher
- If possible, show the downloaded image opened side-by-side with the canvas
