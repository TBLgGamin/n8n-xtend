# Note Title Rename — Demo Video

**Filename:** `note-title.mp4`

## What to record

Screen-record a short walkthrough (30–60s) showing:

1. A workflow open in the editor with one or two sticky notes on the canvas
2. Clicking a sticky note to select it
3. Pressing Space to open the rename dialog
4. Typing a new title and pressing Enter
5. The updated title appearing above the note on the canvas

## Tips

- Start with a sticky note that has no title or a placeholder title so the change is obvious
- Record at 1280×800 or higher, zoom in on the note area so the dialog is clearly visible
- Keep the typing slow so viewers can read the title being entered
