# Show Password — Demo Video

**Filename:** `show-password.mp4`

## What to record

Screen-record a short walkthrough (30–60s) showing:

1. A credential form open in n8n with one or more password fields (dots visible)
2. The eye icon appearing on the right edge of a password field
3. Clicking the eye icon — the password value becomes visible
4. Clicking again — the value is hidden back to dots
5. Optionally: tabbing to the toggle with the keyboard and pressing Enter

## Tips

- Use a test/dummy credential with a clearly fake password so no real secrets are shown
- Record at 1280×800 or higher, zoom in on the credential form
- Move the cursor slowly and pause briefly after each click
