# Variables Syntax — Demo Video

**Filename:** `variables.mp4`

## What to record

Screen-record a short walkthrough (30–60s) showing:

1. A workflow node open with an expression field containing `{{ $json.fieldName }}` tokens
2. The tokens rendered with syntax highlighting (coloured differently from plain text)
3. Clicking a token — it gets copied to the clipboard (show a brief toast or paste it somewhere)
4. Multiple tokens in the same field to show the highlighting applies to all

## Tips

- Use a node like Set or HTTP Request that makes it easy to have several expression fields visible
- Record at 1280×800 or higher, zoom into the expression editor panel
- Paste the copied token into a text editor or another field to confirm the copy worked
