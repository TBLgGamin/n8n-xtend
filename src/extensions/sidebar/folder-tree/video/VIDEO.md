# Folder Tree — Demo Video

**Filename:** `folder-tree.mp4`

## What to record

Screen-record a short walkthrough (30–60s) showing:

1. The n8n sidebar with the folder tree visible on the left
2. Clicking a folder to expand it and reveal nested workflows
3. Collapsing the folder again
4. Dragging a workflow from one folder and dropping it into another
5. Hovering over a nested folder to show the tooltip / highlight state

## Tips

- Use a project with at least 2–3 folders and 4–5 workflows so the tree feels populated
- Record at 1280×800 or higher, crop to just the sidebar + main content area
- Keep the cursor movement deliberate and slow
