# Graph — Demo Video

**Filename:** `graph.mp4`

## What to record

Screen-record a short walkthrough (30–60s) showing:

1. The graph panel open in the sidebar with several workflow nodes visible
2. Scrolling / panning around the graph to show the dependency layout
3. Clicking a node and being taken to that workflow in the editor
4. Navigating back to see the graph still retaining its position

## Tips

- Use a project with at least 5–6 workflows that have trigger/dependency relationships
- Record at 1280×800 or higher, crop to sidebar + main area
- Keep interactions slow and deliberate so viewers can follow
